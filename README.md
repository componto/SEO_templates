To be succeeded on SEO matters don't forget that the best way to otimize ranking is to give crawlers what they want:)
Let's point out some ideas:
-The most important factor is obviously the visits and link building, so invest in digital PR as much as you can. 
Read this: https://moz.com/beginners-guide-to-seo/growing-popularity-and-links

-Mobile is everything, non-responsive websites have lousy SEO rankings

-Unfortunately, Google still cares about the number of pages a site has. Moreover, it is also still important how you
reference the links in the menu and call to actions, use h1's and h2's whenever is possible

-Mention in h1, h2 and paragraph tags the keywords referenced in your meta tags everytime you can, redundancy will help 
you here

-If your site is about a restaurant try to use keywords and texts that refer touristic or known places around the 
restaurant, dont do that only in meta tags

-An updated fresh contents section (news system, blog, etc) is essential, it proves crawlers that you care about your 
site

-Redundancy of contents through the site and social networks are also essential, furthermore, facebook/instagram/twitter 
are important but don't forget that Google+ is the social network made by Google, use it!

-Google Webmaster tools, Google My Business, Google Analytics are also essential as they will provide important SEO 
elements for you such as sitemap, microdata for rich snippets and further information about your contents

-Use alt, title and rel tags in your images (link and a tags as well for rel case) to provide crawlers and screen readers

-Rel attributes are important and can be used in several ways, more info here http://microformats.org/wiki/existing-rel-values 
and here http://www.peckingseo.org/understanding-the-rel-attribute-for-organic-seo/

Tip: Invest in Google AdWords at launch as it will in fact boost your SEO ranking, tests have been made that prove that websites
subject of adwords campaigns rank better then others which didnt when investment ceases. Life isn't fair, money is :/
